<Title />

The ChipInput is an input where the entered values are shown as Chip elements.

By default, values are added when

- the 'space', 'enter' or 'comma' key are pressed
- ChipInput lose the focus (onBlur)

and are deleted when the 'Backspace' key is pressed.

When the internal state of the input changes, the 'onChange' callback is called (with the current internal values as parameter).

You can pass the 'options' prop to populate a Dropdown to show within the ChipInput.
The view of single elements in the Dropdown can be modified passing down a ['customComponent' in the options value](#/Components/Data%20display/Dropdown).

**It's necessary to memoize** 'onChange' and 'onAdd' callbacks to avoid unusual behaviors.

A custom Chip can be used in order to have more control on what a chip can do, but the component has to be an instance of the base Chip.


## onAdd vs onChange
**onAdd** and **onChange** have two different meaning in the chip input:
- **onAdd**: has to be used only for converting a value in a chip. The value received by arg can be a string or the value of a dropdown option,
if present (value intended as the field _value_ of the Dropdown option object)
- **onChange**: onChange is called when a chip is added/removed/replaced from "inside" the chip input component. This means that if you
have to update the value from the outside, you can just change the value prop you pass to your ChipInput, and onChange will not be called.

## Disabled variants

ChipInput elements can be disabled independently.

To disable only the input, use the _disable_ prop.

<Story of={ChipInputStories.DisabledInput} />

To disable the dropdown (hide it), use the _disableOptions_ prop and also leave the _options_ prop empty (or valued with an empty array)

<Story of={ChipInputStories.DisabledDropdown} />

To disable the icon / iconButton, use the _iconDisabled_ prop

<Story of={ChipInputStories.DisabledIcon} />

To entirely disable the chipInput, all the three disabling props has to be set to false and the _options_ prop has to be empty.
If options are provided, they will become visible, and chips can be added through them

<Story of={ChipInputStories.FullDisabledWithOptions} />

## Controlled ChipInput

In controlled mode value can be updated from outside the ChipInput.
When updated, the new value is applied to the ChipInput **without any internal check**,
so **you need to perform any additional check before setting the new value** (e.g. if you intend to have only uniq chips
or a max number of chips).

In the example below, the ChipInput has both the requireUniqChips and the maxChips prop valued. When chips are added directly
through the ChipInput, the checks are done, but when you set a new value through the external component, more than 8 chips are allowed,
and so are duplicates.

## Uncontrolled ChipInput

In uncontrolled mode, the value of the ChipInput is fully controlled by the ChipInput itself.
The chip shape can be manipulated through the onAdd prop.
To get the value of the ChipInput, the onChange callback must be used.

## ChipInput Options

Dropdown is accessible even if chipInput is disabled. This allows chips to be entered only through options and not with typing.
To entirely disable the ChipInput, both the disable options have to be set to false.

When options are provided, and there is some option in the dropdown, blur event does not create a chip.

<Story of={ChipInputStories.DisabledWithOptions} />

To simulate a suggestion mode, value the option prop dynamically, leaving the disableOptions prop set to true

<Story of={ChipInputStories.SuggestionMode} />

To show all options also on focus an additional listener is required

<Story of={ChipInputStories.SuggestionModeWithFocusListener} />

The width of the options dropdown can be changed with the props _dropdownWidth_ and _dropdownMaxWidth_
