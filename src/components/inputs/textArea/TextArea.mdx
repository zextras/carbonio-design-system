TextArea is an HTML textarea element with some styled applied to make it totally similar to the Input component, but with the prerogative of the multiline. All attributes of the HTML textarea are available as props for the TextArea component.

Through the maxHeight prop is possible to set the height limit, beyond which the scroll is activated.
