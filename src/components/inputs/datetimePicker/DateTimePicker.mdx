DateTimePicker is an extension of the picker provided by react-datepicker library. The extension is made to style the
library component in a ds-style and to give a default input ready to be used.

The props shown here are the one defined for the extension, but it is possible to use all the props of the library itself,
where not specified here (in this case, they are being overwritten by our component, with a possible different meaning).
Refer to the official documentation to get a list of them [https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker]()

By default, the DateTimePicker provides 2 types of input, a text input and a chip input.
The behaviour of the two components can differ a bit because of how react-datepicker works under the hood.

Examples of the library component are visible here [https://reactdatepicker.com/]()

### With Custom input
When defining a custom input, it is important to create a component that accepts a ref. React-datepicker offers the possibility to set
a different name for the prop of the input component in charge of accepting the ref object. This prop is `customInputRef`.
In most of the cases, creating a component with React.forwardRef is enough.
React-datetimepicker under the hood takes the customInput (CustomComponent here), clones it, and set some props with internal
implementations. It is important, to have react-datepicker works as expected, to propagate all the standard html attributes to the input component.
The most important ones are
 * value: set the value of the input
 * onClick: makes the picker open on click
 * onChange: perform a validation of the input and set the new value of the picker (and not the input, which is updated by selecting a date/time from the picker)
 * onFocus: makes the picker open on focus
 * onKeyDown: update the picker value while typing
For a better understanding of what react-datepicker does to create the input element, check the method [renderDateInput](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker/blob/10e64e21fddf2b24196d7c17d47670a5be9545f9/src/index.jsx#L1100C6-L1145) of the DatePicker component

<Canvas of={DateTimePickerStories.WithCustomInput} source={{ code: WithCustomInput }} story={{ height: '300px' }} />

### Localization

Accept locale both as a string (and perform the required [registration of react-datepicker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker#localization) automatically)
or as an object, imported from date-fns library.

Locale does not change the "time" label, which requires to be translated from the outside and pass it in the **timeLabel** prop.

#### Important note about bundle
The lib react-datepicker works with _date-fns_.
To avoid importing all locales inside the bundle of the DS, it's left up to the external
project to install date-fns and configure it to limit the bundle size.
See [https://date-fns.org/v2.29.3/docs/webpack]() for more details.

**Important:** check inside installed dependency date-fns/locale for available locales (e.g.: en does not exists, en-US is the default)

Locale can be set in 3 ways:
1) **By registering the locale and set it as default.**
	Locale can be then overridden for a single component by passing the locale prop.
	If not specified differently, default locale is en-US.
	<Canvas of={DateTimePickerStories.WithDefaultLocale} source={{ code: WithDefaultLocale }} story={{ height: '350px' }} />

2) **By registering the locale and pass the locale key as in the locale prop**
	<Canvas of={DateTimePickerStories.WithRegisteredLocale} source={{ code: WithRegisteredLocale }} story={{ height: '350px' }} />

3) **By passing the locale object in the locale prop**
	<Canvas of={DateTimePickerStories.WithLocaleObject} source={{ code: WithLocaleObject }} story={{ height: '350px' }} />
