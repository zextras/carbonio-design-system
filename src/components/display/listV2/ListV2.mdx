<Title />

The items are passed as children of the List component, and the management of the selected, active and
of the other controlled statuses are left to the external Component.

The props **background**, **activeBackground** and **selectedBackground** are available on the main list
with their default, but be aware that they are just passed to the children.
In other words, they represent a short way to define the background on the ListItems.
