### Default and general guidelines

The Banner is the component that informs the user about status of a process.
It remains visible until the user does something for resolving the status, or clicks on “Close” button.

There are four available statuses of this component:

- **Success**: it gives the user positive feedback about the completion of a process.
- **Error**: it gives the user negative feedback about an action that has not been completed or that an error has occurred.
The Banner shows a standard error message, and the user can learn more about it.
- **Warning**: it informs the user that he/she must pay attention to something when doing or after having done an action.
- **Info**: it informs the user about the processing of an action and gives the possibility to the user of undoing the action done.

And three possible types (called _styles_ in the UI kit):

- Fill
- Outline
- Standard

#### Actions:

The available actions are: **Primary** and **Secondary**.

The available actions are freely customizable, which means that you can use all the properties of the button (chevron, icon, etc...).

“**More info**” triggers the modal of example, and is programmatically shown when there is some text cropped.

There is also the **Close** action, which should be used to toggle the visibility of the Banner.
