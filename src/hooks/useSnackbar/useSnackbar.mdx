The useSnackbar hook allows to easily manage stacks of snackbars.

The hook can be accessed from within a _SnackbarManager_ provider, which represents the stack.

By invoking multiple times the creation function returned by the hook, multiple snackbars can be shown one per time,
from the first one created to the last. Each time a snackbar disappears, the next one is shown. This means that if the
snackbar is configured to auto hide (default), when its time expires, the new one will be shown.
But if the snackbar is configured to disable the auto hide, then the new snackbar will appear only if
- the user clicks on the action (when available)
- the close callback returned by the creation function is invoked
- a new snackbar is created with the _replace_ prop enabled
